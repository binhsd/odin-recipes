        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <Li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</Li>
        <p>In a large skillet, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant and translucent. Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.</p>
        
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</li>
        <p>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and lay them flat on a baking sheet or parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>
        
        <l1>Mix the Cheese Filling:</l1>
        <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, a portion of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</p>
        
        <l1>Assemble the Lasagna:</l1>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then add another layer of meat sauce. Repeat these layers until you run out of ingredients, ending with a layer of sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.</p>
        
        <l1>Bake and Serve:</l1>
        <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese on top is bubbly and golden brown. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</p>

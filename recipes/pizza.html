        <li>Olive oil</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <Li>Preheat the Oven:</Li>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</p>
        
        <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
        <p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into your desired shape and thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>
        
        <l1>Add the Sauce:</l1>
        <p>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
        </p>
        
        <l1>Add the Cheese and Seasonings:</l1>
        <p>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese generously over the tomato sauce. Drizzle a little olive oil over the top and add a pinch of dried oregano or fresh basil if desired. You can also sprinkle a small amount of salt for extra flavor.</p>
        
        <l1>Bake the Pizza:</l1>
        <p>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (onto the pizza stone if using) and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, slice, and enjoy your homemade cheese pizza!</p>
